## About the Project
A typical household loses about 10% of its heat through its windows. In an industrial building, the amount of heat energy loss would be at least thrice the amount. To counteract this loss of heat energy, heater and air ventilation systems produce more heat. This energy inefficiency could be cut down sufficiently with smart blind control. The embedded control system will take into account the amount of transient light available and the external temperature to deduce if the blinds need to be drawn or not. 

## Key Terminology
**Embedded Control Systems:** An embedded control system is a microcontroller or microprocessor based system which is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It manages, commands, or regulates the behavior of other devices or peripherals using control loops. 
**Real-Time Operating System:** RTOS, or commonly known as Real-Time Operating System, is a software component that rapidly switches between tasks, giving the impression that multiple programs are being executed at the same time on a single processing core.
**Proportional, Integral and Differential Controller:** PID or a Proportional, Integral and Differential Controller sets to a certain reference as preferred ambient lighting in a room, thereby letting the controller adjust the blinds towards that reference value while conditions outside and inside change during the day. The controller regulates the light that is let through the blind based on a predefined reference value chosen as the amount of indoor lighting.
